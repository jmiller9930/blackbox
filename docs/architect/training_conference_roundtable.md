# Training conference — roundtable record

**Purpose:** Single record of **Agentic Training Advisor ↔ Engineering** on Anna **training governance**, **v1 semantics**, **context/memory**, and related **implementation** — roster, agreements, work, deliverables, and a **standardized exchange log**.

**Maintenance:** On each new Advisor memo or Engineering response, **append one row** to **§6 Exchange log** using the **exact fields** below. **Rewrite §4.1** when memory/control-plane scope changes. Cursor: `.cursor/rules/training-conference-roundtable.mdc`.

## 2 — Session roster

| Role | Party | Part in the roundtable |
|------|--------|-------------------------|
| **Training Architect** | Human / governance authority | PASS **meaning**, trust, risk, v1 scope; **Confirmed** on contract. |
| **Agentic Training Advisor** | Advisory prompts | Memos: criteria, learning loop, evidence, v1 lock, context engine, confirmations. |
| **Engineering (BLACK BOX)** | Codebase / implementation | As-built truth; recommendations; UI/API when directed. |
| **Operator / lab** | Runtime | Deploy, flush, Karpathy — referenced in ops, not a formal seat. |

*Official legal/product sign-off may live outside this repo.*

---

## 3 — Agreed positions (v1 contract — Option A)

*Recommended by Engineering; Architect **Confirmed** is external to repo.*

| Topic | Position |
|-------|----------|
| **PASS** | **Provisional qualification** — thresholds on **current** ledger at evaluation time; **not** durable across regimes/time. |
| **Promotion** | **Qualified method** — not universal “approved everywhere.” |
| **After PASS** | **No automatic** execution/method preference change (unless policy added). |
| **Degradation** | **Manual review** in v1 — no default auto-demotion in gates. |
| **Improvement** | **Operator / directive / config / code** — primary in v1. |
| **Naming** | Do not sell gate PASS as durable **“skill”** without lifecycle contract. |
| **Data vs semantics** | **No hard reset** for wording; **soft reset** = reporting baseline only. |

## 4.1 — Rolling summary (memory & control plane — update in place)

**Purpose:** One place to see **current** training-memory scope without re-reading the exchange log. **Rewrite this subsection** when milestones land; do **not** append here (log stays in §6).

| Topic | Status (as of last edit) |
|-------|---------------------------|
| **Lesson memory (W9)** | SQLite `anna_lesson_memory`, similarity retrieval, validated/promoted-only FACT injection into `build_analysis`, bounded K/min score. |
| **Behavioral impact** | Deterministic `behavior_effect` → `suggested_action` / proposal path; tests in `test_anna_lesson_memory_behavior.py`; proof §7 in `w9bc_checkpoint_proof.md`. |
| **Control-plane engagement** | **Runtime:** `memory_control_plane.py` — signals (`detect_problem_signals`), mode (`select_engagement_mode`), retrieval overrides (`effective_retrieval_params`); integrated in `analysis.py`; output `anna_analysis_v1.memory_control_plane`. Default `ANNA_LESSON_MEMORY_CONTROL_PLANE` on when unset; `=0` restores baseline-only retrieval math. |
| **Tests** | `test_memory_control_plane.py` + existing W9 lesson tests. |
| **Design / gap history** | [`problem_aware_lesson_memory_control_plane.md`](problem_aware_lesson_memory_control_plane.md) (directive + implementation table). |
| **Open** | Per phase: Foreman log / clawbot proof if required by `execution_context.md`. |
| **Risk review (R019)** | Tier 1: operator lesson lifecycle + heuristic CP + similarity = **assistive**; improve via **targeted** tuning and richer situation data—not Tier 2 “adaptation” without contract. |
| **Tier 1 lesson lifecycle** | **Accepted & track closed (R021).** Definition unchanged from R020: operator `candidate` → human `validated` → optional `promoted`; injection **validated/promoted only**; assistive memory; no autonomous learning. **Clarifications:** `promoted` vs `validated` = **governance only** in Tier 1 (same code path); minimum bar = **training plan**, not code enforcement; lesson quality = **training/process** ownership. **Next:** Tier 1 completion validation → Tier 2 transition planning (separate). |
| **Tier 1 final validation (R022)** | **Behavior-focused closure memo** — Engineering: deterministic + gate + ledger paths **test-backed**; LLM path **not** strictly deterministic; live production proof = **operator / primary host** per project standards. |
| **Tier 1 script adherence (R023)** | **Controlled `anna_analysis_v1` proof** — [`docs/working/tier1_behavioral_validation_proof.json`](../working/tier1_behavioral_validation_proof.json) (`ANNA_USE_LLM=0`, memory off). |
| **Clawbot remote runtime (W10)** | **Partially met** — `main` synced on clawbot; `pyth-stream` stable (Hermes probe); Pyth API `healthy`; context engine `healthy`; `market_ticks` advancing; host `anna_training_cli.py loop-daemon` running; execution DB has historical `paper` / `paper_stub` trades and `decision_traces`. **Round 025:** `/api/v1/runtime/status` now derives **`running`** when sequential learning **`running`**; dashboard polls **~1.5s**; **`sequential-tick`** sidecar POSTs ticks; raw JSON removed. **Round 027:** **`liveness`** on dashboard bundle — server **bundle as-of**, **staleness** (LIVE / STALLED), **Pyth age**, **poll/tick cadence** text; **not** an order-book stream. **Round 028 (2026-04):** **trade chain** — vs-baseline pairing (incl. **`paper_stub`** when PnL+MAE), **`anna_vs_baseline_aggregate`**, **scorecard**, **`operator_trading`** + registry-backed promote/demote API; docs synced (`development_plan.md`, `blackbox_master_plan.md`). **UI visibility** on a host requires **API restart + hard refresh** — old `dashboard.html` looks unchanged. **Remaining:** operator **Start** with valid paths + keypair in `.env`; clawbot **T1/T2** proof (counters, ledger rows); wallet still needs keypair file visible in container. |

- Each round uses **one row** in the table below with **all columns filled** (use `—` if N/A).
- **Round** = monotonic integer (001, 002, …).

**Columns**

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|

| 010 | 2026-04 | Engineering | Context engine contract memo — **formal reply to Architect / Advisor** | Same eight-part request; official answer package for governance. | Memo below + `context_engine_as_built.md` (authoritative detail). | closed |
| 011 | 2026-04 | Advisor | **W8 enforcement** — memory-driven contract (doc + code + tests mandatory) | Requires similarity retrieval, structured lessons, separation history/memory/ops, proof artifacts. | **`context_memory_contract_w8.md`** — **gap identified** (§8); **W9** opened; not compliant as-built. | closed |
| 012 | 2026-04 | Advisor | **W9 in-scope now** — not optional; core training capability | Direction: implement minimum memory-driven behavior; W9 = active track. | **`w9_implementation_plan.md`** — MVP slice, code areas, tests, safety; W9 status → active. | closed |
| 013 | 2026-04 | Engineering | **W9a checkpoint** — schema + `lesson_memory` + tests | Sliced delivery; validation rules explicit (`candidate` never injects). | Schema `schema_phase4_anna_lessons.sql`, `lesson_memory.py`, 5 pytest green; plan §8–9 updated. | closed |

| 018 | 2026-04 | Architect | **Verification — proof of implementation** | Code + runtime + tests, not design-only. | Pytest evidence; `build_analysis` JSON excerpts (`memory_control_plane`); behavioral comparison baseline vs problem-state. | closed |
| 019 | 2026-04 | Architect | **Context engine — risk review & forward alignment** (Tier 1 / Tier 2) | Supply chain, heuristics, similarity vs recognition, engagement, effect scope, tier boundaries; no scope expansion request. | Engineering assessment: operator-governed lesson lifecycle default; heuristics sufficient for Tier 1 with telemetry-led tuning; similarity MVP appropriate; targeted improvements path; Tier 1 = assistive only. See reply in thread / this round. | closed |
| 020 | 2026-04 | Architect | **Tier 1 — lesson lifecycle locked (operational)** | Creation / validation / promotion / minimum usable set; no Tier 2 automation; gap is process not code. | Engineering definition: operator creates `candidate` → human validates → optional human `promoted`; minimum bar by phase in training plan; implementation gaps = no mandatory UI queue, `validated`≡`promoted` for injection. **Canonical:** Round 020 summary in this row + Engineering memo. | closed |
| 021 | 2026-04 | Architect | **Acceptance — Tier 1 lesson lifecycle** | Lock and close track; clarifications on promoted vs validated (governance only), minimum bar in training plan, ownership = training/process. | **Accepted as written.** No additional code for Tier 1 lifecycle; no automation of validation/promotion; no Tier 2 expansion from this track. **Next:** Tier 1 completion validation → Tier 2 transition planning. **Track closed.** | closed |
| 022 | 2026-04 | Architect | **Tier 1 closure — final validation** (behavior) | Script, signals, `anna_analysis_v1`, ledger, gates, determinism; proof where applicable. | Engineering response: deterministic paths + gates + ledger logic **substantiated** by automated tests; LLM-on path **not** strictly deterministic; production primary-host proof **out of scope** for this memo. See Round 022 Engineering reply. | closed |
| 023 | 2026-04 | Architect | **Tier 1 — behavioral validation (script adherence)** | Controlled scenarios: input, expected, full `anna_analysis_v1`, pass/fail; no metrics-only closure. | **`docs/working/tier1_behavioral_validation_proof.json`** — `build_analysis`, `ANNA_USE_LLM=0`, lesson memory off; scenarios S1–S6; duplicate-input determinism verified separately. | closed |
| 024 | 2026-04-05 | Engineering | **W10 — Clawbot-only operationalization** (Git sync, pyth-stream, wallet, sequential, Anna/learning proof) | Architect directive: prove system on **clawbot** only; no local-only proof; fix unhealthy services; truthful wallet; RUNNING sequential + trade-and-train evidence. | **Shipped:** `scripts/trading/pyth_stream_probe.py` (fixes `pyth-stream` crash — missing script); `UIUX.Web/docker-compose.yml` env passthrough (`KEYPAIR_PATH`, `BLACKBOX_SOLANA_KEYPAIR_PATH`, `SOLANA_RPC_URL`, `BLACKBOX_LIVE_TRADING_BLOCKED`, `BLACKBOX_EXECUTION_LEDGER_PATH`); `modules/wallet/solana_wallet.py` governance flag; `scripts/runtime/operational_readiness_clawbot.sh`. **Clawbot verified (SSH):** `main` @ `7fd7cd90bd9dda4062589617317fb8b9a705c796`; containers Up; Pyth `healthy`; sequential API **`idle`**; wallet **`wallet_connected: false`** (no keypair in container); `runtime/status` **not_connected**; Anna host process running; DB counts non-zero historically. **Not accepted** vs full directive until wallet wired, sequential **running**, unified dashboard proof. **W10** open. | open |
| 025 | 2026-04-05 | Engineering | **Dashboard live + runtime truth** (motion, `/api/v1/runtime/status`, sequential tick sidecar) | Architect directive: operator-visible motion; RUNNING sequential; runtime endpoint reflects processes; poll faster; remove raw JSON; periodic tick. | **`build_status`:** sequential **`running`** → `runtime_state` **`running`**, ledger health wired, Anna agent **`sequential_learning_active`**; `sequential_learning` block on `/api/v1/runtime/status`. **`dashboard.html`:** poll **1.5s**; removed raw bundle JSON; control messages human-readable. **`sequential_http_tick_loop.py` + compose `sequential-tick`:** POST tick every 5s to `api:8080` (no-op when idle). **API `dns`:** 8.8.8.8 for Jupiter resolution attempts. **Proof on clawbot** still required (T1/T2 counters, wallet `.env`). | open |
| 026 | 2026-04-05 | Engineering | **W10 closure attempt — clawbot RUNNING + T1/T2 + wallet** | Directive: no code-only closure; start sequential with real paths; wallet truthful when configured. | **Clawbot executed:** `bootstrap_clawbot_sequential_demo.py --container-prefix /repo` → **`start_ok`**, **`ui_state: running`**. **T1→T2 (≥30s):** `events_processed_total` **5 → 24**, `last_processed_market_event_id` advanced, **`/api/v1/runtime/status`** **`running`** / **`sequential_learning_running`**. **`UIUX.Web/.env`:** `BLACKBOX_SOLANA_KEYPAIR_PATH=/repo/trading_core/keypair.json`. **Wallet bug fixed:** API image had no Node — pubkey now **PyNaCl**; **`wallet_connected: true`** on clawbot after **`11759cc`**. **Artifacts:** `data/sequential_engine/clawbot_demo/calibration.json`, generated `events.txt`. **`anna_sequential_decision_runs`** remained 0 over sample (SPRT batching — separate check). **W10:** partial acceptance — dashboard motion + RUNNING proven; operator screen capture still per memo. | open |
| 027 | 2026-04-05 | Engineering | **Operator-visible liveness** (heartbeat, cadence, not RUNNING alone) | Architect directive: dashboard must show update cadence, last updated, distinguish live vs stalled — not exchange “tape”. | **`liveness` block** on **`/api/v1/dashboard/bundle`**: `bundle_generated_at_utc`, `update_model` (poll 1500ms, tick ~5s, Pyth ~15s), `operator_signals` (events processed/queue, last tick, Pyth age), **`tick_staleness`** (`LIVE` / `LIVE (SLOW)` / `STALLED`), `not_exchange_tick_stream` explanation. **`dashboard.html`:** liveness strip + pulse on each poll + color by staleness. **`dashboard_bundle.py`** helpers `_pyth_probe_snapshot`, `_sequential_tick_staleness`. | closed |
