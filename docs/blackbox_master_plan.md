# BLACK BOX — MASTER PROJECT PLAN

## Overview

This document defines the full Phase 1 bootstrap for Cody (Code Bot) using OpenClaw.

---

## Core Philosophy

- Pattern recognition over prediction
- Structured learning
- Risk-controlled decisions
- No autonomous unsafe behavior

---

## Phase 1 Goal

Build Cody as an OpenClaw SKILL-driven engineering agent.

---

## Key Components

### Cody — Code Bot

**Role:**

- Software engineer agent
- System architect
- Planning and scaffolding

**NOT:**

- Trader
- Analyst
- Execution bot

## SKILL.md Core

- **name:** `cody_planner`
- **Purpose:** Plan system architecture, recommend build steps, guide development (see `agents/cody/skills/cody-planner/SKILL.md` in-repo).

---

## OpenClaw Integration

OpenClaw loads skills from `<workspace>/skills` (highest precedence), then `~/.openclaw/skills`, then bundled skills. The canonical copy in **git** lives at `agents/cody/skills/`.

**Make skills visible to the gateway** by one of:

- Copying `cody-planner` into `<workspace>/skills/` (symlinks that escape the workspace root may be **rejected** by OpenClaw), or  
- Setting `skills.load.extraDirs` in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` to an allowed path (see OpenClaw docs: *Skills*, *Creating Skills*).

**Verify:**

```bash
openclaw skills list
```

---

## Test Prompt

Use the Cody planner skill to recommend next steps for building BLACK BOX.

---

## Success Criteria

- Cody loads in OpenClaw
- Cody responds as engineering agent
- No trading behavior
- Structured outputs

---

## Final Rule

If unclear: **STOP → LOOK UP DOCS → THEN IMPLEMENT**
